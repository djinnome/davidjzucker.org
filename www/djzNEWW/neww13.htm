There is a Jewish conversational style.</i></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%">It
is widely accepted that different ethnic groups have distinctive and meaningful
patterns of conversational style that are known – almost intuitively – to
their members. Jews are no exception.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
patterns of conversation that are found among most Jews, especially those of
Eastern European origin, differ in significant ways from patterns of
conversation found among most non-Jews in America. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%">For
example: experienced from the “outside,” non-Jewish listeners often notice
that Jewish speakers tend to interrupt the flow of a conversation and therefore,
judge them as being rude. In that same conversation – but experienced from the
“inside” - those same Jewish speakers perceive that they are engaged and are
actively and respectfully participating. Georgetown University Professor Deborah
Tannen, an internationally acclaimed expert in linguistics, calls this normative
Jewish behavior “high-involvement” and “cooperative overlapping.” She
affirms - what Jewish speakers basically know intuitively - that talking as
another person continues to talk is one way that Jews show interest and
appreciation. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%">Also
typical of Jewish conversational style are: a faster rate of speech, faster
turn-taking among speakers, abrupt shifts of topics, persistence in
reintroducing a topic if others do not immediately notice it, unhesitating
introduction of new topics, and a preference for personal topics.<sup><a href="neww16.htm#FN34">34</a></sup><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Tannen further affirms that the very sounds of Jewish-style talk,
including: pitch shifts, volume changes, and voice quality and accent
exaggerations signal empathy and concern even as they reinforce a shared ethnic
(and sometimes, a regional) background. In conversation, Jews find all of these
conversational modalities unremarkable. Tannen notes that “You show you’re a
good person by demonstrating enthusiastic participation in the conversation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>You offer talk as a gift.”<a href="neww16.htm#FN35"><sup>35</sup></a></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%">Jews
also tend to tell stories in their conversations, often in rounds. Instead of
stating the point of a story directly, Jews often dramatize it through another
story while focusing upon the emotional experience of that story. Those whose
backgrounds promote different ways of conversing may not “get the point” of
these story-telling rounds that sometimes seem not to have a plot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They also may find the expression -and implied expectation - of personal
revelation unnerving and intrusive. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%">Unfortunately,
the very characteristics that promote good communication within one group can
create a “style disconnect” within mixed groups. For example, the same “high-involvement”
and “cooperative overlapping” that are so welcome and positively interpreted
within Jewish groups often put-off those who are used to more restrained and
less expressive ways of speaking. According to Tannen, “overlap is used
cooperatively … as a way of showing enthusiasm and interest, but it is
interpreted by [outsiders] as just the opposite: evidence of lack of
attention.&quot;<sup><a href="neww16.htm#FN36">36</a></sup> On the other side of
the coin, some ethnic or regional groups value pauses and silence as evidence of
respect while Jews tend to interpret these conversational modalities as evidence
of lack of rapport and/or interest.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%">Beyond
this, people often make erroneous judgments about the personality of individuals
who express themselves according to their normative ethnic (and regional)
conversational styles. Tannen points out that negative stereotypes of “pushy
New York Jews” may owe considerably more to clashing linguistic patterns than
to character flaws. She explains that in her research, she “found out that New
York Jews have ways of talking that often have one effect (a good one) when used
with one another and another effect (not so good) when used with others.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Of course, some New Yorkers who are not of East European Jewish
background talk this way, and so do people who are neither from New York nor
Jewish. But there are many who do - enough to account for the negative
stereotype.”<a href="neww16.htm#FN37"><sup>37</sup></a></span></p>
