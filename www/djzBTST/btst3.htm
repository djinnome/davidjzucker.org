<p>Believing the victim, and taking seriously charges of sexual boundary
violations, however, is but a rare occurrence.</p>
<p>The veil of silence, however, is slowly lifting. Yet, only limited segments
of the rabbinic, cantorial, and lay leadership publicly are addressing this
issue.</p>
<p>The Orthodox movement has yet to address this issue publicly in print in its
&quot;house&quot; journals, and the Conservative movement scheduled its first
article on this subject in its congregational-based magazine, <i>United
Synagogue Review</i>, for Winter, 2004.<sup><a href="btst7.htm#EN10">10</a></sup>
The Reform and Reconstructionist movements have taken a lead in addressing the
matter of clergy sexual boundaries violations, publishing articles as early as
1993. Of primary note are several articles in the <i>CCAR Journal</i>, the
professional journal of the Reform rabbinate, and one in Reconstructionist
movement's journal, <i>The Reconstructionist</i>.</p>
<p>The first article to address this issue within the official
rabbinic/congregational world was the 1993 work by Rachel Adler, &quot;A
Stumbling Block Before the Blind: Sexual Exploitation in Pastoral
Counseling.&quot; Her article commences with some general definitions of sexual
contact and sexual exploitation. Sexual contact includes any kind of
penetration, any kind of inappropriate touching, or narration of sexual
fantasies by a counselor to a client. Sexual exploitation is contact which
violates roles, and she points out that &quot;<i>The exploiter's insistence that
the sexual activity be kept secret can be interpreted as a tacit admission of
role violation</i>&quot; (emphasis in original). Adler writes about
&quot;Transference and Counter-transference&quot; and she highlights the gulf
between rabbis [cantors, chaplains, and other revered figures] and congregants.
Her remarks, while mentioning rabbis specifically, are equally applicable to
cantors and chaplains. She suggests that rabbis possess specialized knowledge.
Further, there is a discrepancy between rabbis and congregants' roles. This
discrepancy, plus the rabbis' familiarity with sacred texts, sacred objects,
Hebrew language and Jewish tradition allows congregants to endow the rabbi with
a spiritual and supernatural aura and unique priestly powers. The rabbis play
out their part by agreeing to be the &quot;ideal parent of childhood fantasy,
who nurtures selflessly and magically ensures safety and well-being.&quot; This
in turn &quot;creates religious environments rife with potential for
abuse.&quot; She mentions a typology of six offenders, suggesting that in many,
if not most cases treatment is difficult, if not impossible, and that there are
persons who cannot be rehabilitated. The article concludes with sections dealing
with recommendations regarding offenses and recommendations dealing with
offenders.<sup><a href="btst7.htm#EN11">11</a></sup></p>
<p>In 1994 Rabbi Howard Kosovske, in response to Rachel Adler published an
article dealing with &quot;Sexual Exploitation: A Jewish Response,&quot;<sup><a href="btst7.htm#EN12">12</a></sup>
wherein he examined a Talmudic response to the issue of a rabbinic sexual
boundary violation found in the tractate <i>Moed Katan</i> 17a.</p>
<p>Again in the <i>CCAR Journal</i>, Stephen S. Pearce's article &quot;Betrayal,
Sex, Power, Trust, and Unfinished Business&quot;<sup><a href="btst7.htm#EN13">13</a></sup>
points out that clergy are particularly vulnerable to indiscretions, and that
the term rabbi - and the words cantor or chaplain as well - make these clergy
&quot;more vulnerable to both innocents and predators, as well as to their own
uncontrollable desires.&quot; He writes about the &quot;Heroic-Wounded Healer
versus the Needy-Supplicant&quot; and how easy it is for a rabbi [cantor or
chaplain] to overstep appropriate limits. He explains that because the rabbi
[cantor, or chaplain] is held in a position of awe, that with this position
comes a sense of the &quot;divine, spiritual, supernatural, mysterious&quot; and
so the rabbi/cantor/chaplain becomes the &quot;embodiment of such otherworldly
power.&quot; He goes on to say, that consequently for some people, &quot;having
sex with a clergyperson is like having sex with God.&quot;</p>
<p>In his article, like Adler, he offers some characteristics of Boundary
Violations, and offers some Strategies for Maintaining Boundaries. Among his
strategies he suggests Consultation with someone trusted if you feel you might
be about to violate a boundary, and then such other points as Self Awareness,
Refer-Refer-Refer, and Adequate Training.</p>
<p align="left">Arthur Gross-Schaefer, writing in <i>The Reconstructionist </i>points
out that when &quot;rabbinic colleagues and lay leaders keep the 'secret,' the
abusing rabbi can continue the violation either in the existing congregation or
at the next with the belief that his actions will be kept a 'family secret.' In
this way, colleagues, lay leadership, and religious institutions become part of
the conspiracy which allows the abusive activity to continue.&quot;<sup><a href="btst7.htm#EN14">14</a></sup></p>
