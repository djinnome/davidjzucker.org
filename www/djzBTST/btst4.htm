<p>In 2003, Rachel Lev published <i>Shine the Light: Sexual Abuse and Healing in
the Jewish Community</i>.<sup><a href="btst7.htm#EN15">15</a></sup> This book
has two major sections, &quot;The Context: Survivors Then and Now, Denial,
Jewish Law and Family Dynamics,&quot; and &quot;Hope for the Future: The Healing
Journey for Individuals and Communities.&quot;</p>
<p><i>Shine the Light</i> is a blend between personal anecdotal accounts of
abuse, and scholarly articles. Of note is the chapter written by Rabbi Eliot N.
Dorff of the University of Judaism, &quot;Jewish Law and Tradition Regarding
Sexual Abuse and Incest.&quot; Dorff also wrote a chapter entitled &quot;The
Role of Rabbis, Cantors, and Educators in Preventing Abuse and Repairing its
Consequences.&quot;</p>
<p>Also noteworthy is Marcia Cohn Spiegel's article on &quot;Survival and
Recovery: Jewish Women Confront Abuse.&quot;</p>
<p><i>Shine the Light</i> contains several appendices which offer practical
advice for Rabbis, Educators, Cantors, Parents, Health Care Professionals,
Medical and Clinical Professionals and others who would help. Among these are
sections on &quot;When an Adult Says, 'I've Been Abused,'&quot; and &quot;When a
Friend or Family Member Says, 'I've Been Abused'&quot; as well as a list of
Agencies, Resources and Websites.</p>

<p>In terms of <u>fictional</u> depictions, until very recently the subject of
rabbinic, cantorial, and chaplaincy sexual boundary violations, took only one
form. This was the male rabbi as philanderer or sexual predator.<sup><a href="btst7.htm#EN16">16</a></sup>
In these novels, the innocent victims, the preyed-upon were adult women, seduced
by charismatic rabbis. In these fictional instances, as in real life, there is
no such category as a &quot;consenting adult.&quot; People are overwhelmed by
the rabbi's (or cantor's or chaplain's) &quot;spiritual and supernatural
aura&quot; (Adler). Nonetheless, sexual abuse of adults is different from the
sexual abuse of children.</p>
<p>Sexual abuse of children by rabbis, cantors, and chaplains in the real world
is an indisputably, and regrettably established fact, as recent convictions
attest. Yet, despite these facts, with but one exception this subject never has
been addressed in the world of fiction. That one and only exception to this
conspiracy of silence is Carol Matas' 1995 novel, <i>The Primrose Path</i>.<sup><a href="btst7.htm#EN17">17</a></sup>
In many ways, this has been an underground book. It is said that Matas, the
author of the acclaimed Holocaust novel, <i>Daniel's Story</i> (and <i>Sworn
Enemies</i>), was unable to find a publisher in the United States for this book.
&quot;It will not sell,&quot; she was told, &quot;it will do your career no
good&quot;; &quot;the Jewish community is not ready for this.&quot; She had to
go north of the border to Winnipeg to find a publisher.</p>
<p>The story revolves around a teenage Jewish girl in the ninth grade. Following
her family relocating to a new community, suddenly and unexpectedly she is
enrolled in a local Orthodox <i>yeshiva</i>. The rabbi/principal is charismatic,
handsome, and witty. Over a number of years, he built up his congregation and
his school, where it now has a very fine academic reputation.</p>
<p>During the course of the novel, it becomes clear that the rabbi is a sexual
predator with both a series of women in the congregation and with many of the
children. hides his shadow side. Under the pretext of teasing, flirting,
hugging, and kissing, he surreptitiously takes advantage of his position of
trust. He takes some children into his office, locks the door, and then fondles
and touches them inappropriately.</p>
<p>The novel, at least morally, concludes on a difficult note. When finally
confronted, the rabbi denies the allegations. Instead of some kind of
retributive justice, blame falls on the victims, the community goes into denial,
and it would appear that the perpetrator goes free.<sup><a href="btst7.htm#EN18">18</a></sup>
<p>This reaction in the novel reflects accurately the reality that victims often
face. As a real world article dealing with community denial of rabbinic sexual
abuse described it:</p>

    <tr>
      <td width="100%"><!--mstheme--><font face="Trebuchet MS, Arial, Helvetica">People do not want to think that their rabbi is capable
        of sexual exploitation . . . when exploitation does occur, the women who
        come forward often find themselves ostracized by their religious
        community . . . on the rare occasions that they turn to the rabbi's
        professional associations or their movement's congregational
        organization, they say they are made to feel unwelcome. The result is a
        conspiracy of silence that protects the perpetrators and leaves the
        victims feeling isolated and in pain, alienated from the very Jewish
        community to which they turned for spiritual sustenance . . .
        Congregants are often so deeply invested in keeping their rabbis on a
        pedestal that they are unwilling or unable to consider that they may do
        something so fundamentally offensive. And so they often deny it . . .
        synagogue members will often stand up and ostracize the accuser. In some
        cases, the accusers have been called &quot;liars&quot; and
        &quot;whores&quot; - and worse . . .<a href="btst7.htm#EN19"><sup>19</sup></a><!--mstheme--></font></td>

<p>What is even more disturbing is that the description of the rabbi in this
novel, <i>The Primrose Path</i>, and the reaction of the community to the
alleged sexual abuse has a real-life counterpart in the accusations leveled at
Rabbi Ephraim Bryks, formerly of Winnipeg, Manitoba, and more recently of
Queens, New York. In 1994, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation aired a video,
&quot;Unorthodox Conduct&quot; which narrated the sordid history of Rabbi Bryks.<sup><a href="btst7.htm#EN20">20</a></sup>
Though challenged in court by defenders of Rabbi Byrks, this video by the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation has withstood litigation against its public
viewing.<br>
