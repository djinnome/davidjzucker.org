</span>Zucker observes: “although now, ritualized daily prayer as a way to
consciously engage in dialogue with God is a regular part of my life - as it is
for many Jews, there was a time when I did not follow this practice – along
with many other Jews. I remember mentioning this to an Episcopalian colleague
one day following an interfaith ministerial meeting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>He looked shocked, or perhaps disappointed, and then he turned to me and
asked, ‘how then do you keep in touch with God?’<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was an important lesson for me, because I had to articulate what I
already knew in my heart which was that I keep in touch with God through my
daily actions that attempt to improve the world and not, through what I believe.”<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%">Jews
are considerably less concerned than Christians are about the state of their
belief. In fact, a seeming contradiction within Judaism as a religion is that
non-belief in God, and certainly the lack of a systematic belief system, is not
incompatible with being Jewish.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
to contemporary theologian, Rabbi Neil Gillman, “Most Jews . . . have never
given much thought to clarifying just what we believe about God, nor do we feel
that our religiosity is any the worse for it . . .<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>.”<a href="neww16.htm#FN16"><sup>16</sup></a> Clarifying and
systematizing what Jews believe in has not been as intrinsically important to
Judaism as it has been to Christianity. Although space here does not allow for a
full explanation, one can be Jewish, and belong to a synagogue, and still not
have a firm belief in God.<o:p>

late Harry Kemelman brings this point home in the popular weekday “Rabbi-as-detective”
series.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In a wonderfully
illustrative point in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Monday the Rabbi
Took Off,</i> fictional “Rabbi Small” is asked if he believes in God. “Rabbi
Small” replies that “It’s a difficult question” to answer because “it
involves three variables.” These variables include, “do you mean at this
moment in time, or the I of yesterday, or the I of three years ago? And what do
you mean by ‘believe’? That’s another variable. Do you mean in the same
way that I believe that two and two make four? Or the way that I believe that
light travels a certain number of miles per second, which I myself have never
seen demonstrated but which has been demonstrated by people whose competence and
integrity I have been taught to trust?… And finally, the third variable –
God. Do you mean a humanlike figure? Or an ineffable essence? One who is aware
of us individually and responsive to our pleas for help? Or one who is so far
above us that [God] can have no interest in us?”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The “rabbi” concludes with this statement: “I suppose I have the
feeling of belief and certainty some times and lack it at others.”<a href="neww16.htm#FN17"><sup>17<o:p></o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%">In
another weekday novel, “Rabbi Small” explains that Jewish people can walk in
God’s ways and still have doubts about God’s existence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>“After all, you can’t always control your thoughts.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Further he says, faith “is not a requirement of our religion. . . I
suspect it’s a kind of special talent that some have to a greater degree than
others.”<a href="neww16.htm#FN18"><sup>18<o:p></o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: 100%; mso-pagination: none"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;line-height:200%">Since
belief in God is not a sine qua non for being part of the Jewish people, a Jew
who claims to be “not-religious” may still be recognized as fully Jewish by
other mainstream Jews.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Non-Jews
should not underestimate the power of Jewish cultural and ethnic ties. When Jews
say they are “not-religious”, it does not mean that they are assimilated
into our Western, Christianized world and certainly, it does not mean that they
are open or ripe for conversion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
may simply mean that they are observant of some Jewish rituals and not observant
of other Jewish rituals; for example, they may not keep the laws of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
